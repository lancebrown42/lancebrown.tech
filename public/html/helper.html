<p>The above is a screen capture from my midterm project from RefactorU, entitled <i>help.er</i>. It will link you to the firebase hosted app, which was built over 3 days, without any knowledge of backend processes. The app is designed to be an interface for the more tech-savvy generation to provide remote tech support to their less savvy family and friends. The "helpee" submits a ticket, after being prompted with some common fixes, and the "helper" gets a writeup posted to their dashboard, and the option to resolve and close out a ticket. If the issue cannot be resolved, there is an option to start a Google Hangout.</p>
<p>help.er uses Angular as well as the angular-ui-router library and manifests as a SPA. The login authentication is spoofed and no credentials are actually stored, since at the time I had not learned how to authenticate. I will not be adding full functionality to this, so that I may demonstrate what I did in three days without knowing how to run a server or database.</p>
